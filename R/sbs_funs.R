#' FUN: get_sbs
#' 
#' This function cleans up the columns in a SBS matrix so that is it really for 
#' joining and final plotting. If the matrices have difference choice options, AND factors are set to TRUE
#' then it returns a list containing a DF for each sub matrix. Otherwise it returns a regular df. 
#' It's not ideal for a function to return 2 diff data types but in this instance, there may not be a better way if you want factors
#' 
#' @param quest_obj the object within the qsurvey object that contains all relevant information to the question including choicses and subquestions IF those are relevant
#' @param quest_wrap an integer value defining the number of characters at which you want to specify a line break for each question at for prettier plotting. default = NULL which means no wrap
#' @param choice_wrap an integer value defining the number of characters at which you want to specify a line break for each CHOICE at for prettier plotting. default = NULL which means no wrap
#' @param choice_factor boolean set to TRUE if you want choices to be turned into a factor and ordered by the order provided in qualtrics (this is the order that you provided to the user in the survey)
#' @param choice_rev boolean set to TRUE if you want to reverse the order of choices 
#' @return data.frame of choices ready to be merged
